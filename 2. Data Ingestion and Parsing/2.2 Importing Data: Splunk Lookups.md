* However, what if we also want to reflect the name of the customer? This client name information is tored in the lookups.csv file instead. 

## Use Case 2: Importing data - lookup. Create a new lookups.csv

* Select 'Settings' > 'Lookups'

  ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/861eafc3-6814-4319-bb81-62f3217ea495)

* Create a new lookup by clicking on '+ add new'

  ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9bd5a099-b0fe-49d8-8f59-bb17210d8dd5)

* Upload the 'lookups.csv' file > add Destination filename as 'kplabslookup.csv' > select 'save'

  ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/74380d1d-e398-4a14-b6cb-555a8ebcabcb)

* Lookup 'kplabslookup.csv' uploaded

  ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5ff9a922-2b42-4259-9d09-6639b11a9dc4)

* Now customerName is also reflected as a field within the events.

  ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/57bf49da-1072-49f9-ba9b-0f4919336f29)

* if you remove '| lookup kplabslookup.csv customerId as customerID' from your query, the event will no longer contain the customer name.

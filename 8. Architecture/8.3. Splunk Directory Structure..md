# Splunk Directory Structure

## Key Reminders

### 1. Default vs. local vs. app directories

* We can have configuration files with same sever names and field names (different values) in **default**, **local**, and **app directories**.

1. System Local -- highest priority
2. App Local Directory
3. App default directory
4. System Default Directory** -- lowest priority

**System Default directory is to never be changed. Why? Whenver you do a Splunk Upgrade, all the configurations within the default directory, they will be changed. If you make any change to the default configuration files, they will be overwritten during the upgrade, and your Splunk installation will stop working. 

### 2. Priority among collection of app directories

* App directory names also affects the precedence. To determine Priority among collection of app directories, Splunk uses lexicographical order.
* Files in an apps directory named "A" have a higher priority than files in an apps directory names "B"
* all apps starting with an uppercase letter have precedence over any apps starting with a lowercase letter (e.g., "A" has precedence over "Z", but "Z" has precedence over "a")
* Example:
  1. /opt/splunk/etc/system/local/*
  2. /opt/splunk/etc/apps/A/local/* > /opt/splunk/etc/apps/z/local/*
  3. /opt/splunk/etc/apps/A/default/* > /opt/splunk/etc/apps/z/default/*
  4. /opt/splunk/etc/system/default/*

# (In Linux) Configure Universal Forwarder (agent), receiving, monitoring
**Description:** agent that collects data from a server and send it to Splunk

  **Universal Forwarder Configuration Steps**
*    1. Configure receiving on a Splunk Enterprise instance
*    2. Download and install the UF on the source system
*    3. Start the UF
*    4. Configure the UF to send data
*    5. Configure the UF to collect data from the host system

## Step 1: Configure receiving on a Splunk Enterprise instance
* For the logs to be sent from the Universal Forwarder, there needs to be a receiving port at the Splunk site (Port 9997).
* Select ***Settings*** > **Forwarding & Receiving** > **Configure Receiving**

* Port of 9997 created

## Step 2: Download and install the Universal Forwarder on the Source System
* Go to: https://www.splunk.com/en_us/download.html > 'Get my Free Download' for Universal Forwarder

  ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9e2df28d-256a-4bc4-83a0-664a6f6c87ba)

* Select 64-bit > .deb for 'Ubuntu Linux Server' > copy the wget link for .deb

  ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c4d2efe4-e08b-4879-8c14-daf9ef548934)

* Within Command Line, login to Universal Forwarder server

* Type root@157.230.11.23 (Splunk Public IP Address) > paste the wget link

  ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/db9655d2-e053-459a-a15a-51f11d174ce8)

* Type **ls** and you will find .deb file that was recently downloaded. Type **dpkg -i --.deb file--**

  ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/acc0e7be-838a-4978-9dcc-f85e4cfbb0c4)

* Type **cd /opt/splunkforwarder**. Type **cd bin** to access bin directory for Universal Forwarder. Type **ls** to view all sub-directories.

## Step 3: Start the UF
* Type **./splunk start**. Type **./splunk status**, should now reflect Splunk Forwarder is running.

* Type **./splunk list monitor** to see log files that the Splunk forwarder would be sending.
* These are the directories that are currently being monitored; however, you see that no system level logs are being monitored. When you connect this Splunk forwarder to the Splunk index, there are certain log files that needs to be sent. You can determine which are the log files that you want to be indexed.

### Test that connection is successful between Server's Universal Forwarder and Splunk Instance (Port 9997)
* **Note** Remember that on Step 1, we configured receiving to be on Port 9997

* To identify if there is connectivity between Universal Forwarder and Splunk instance, within Command LIne type **telnet 157.230.11.23 9997** (157.230.11.23 is the IP address of the Splunk Instance and 9997 is the port number of the Splunk Instance)

### Monitor the appropriate log files that are sent to Splunk.

* Within the Universal Forwarder instance, by typing **ls -l /var/log**, you can see the list of logs that are stored in the var/log directory

* We need to make sure that these logs are being sent to the central Splunk instance. How to do this?

  <img width="722" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f1d50433-c823-44b6-920c-fc23ff6d2c26" />

* You need to specify to the Splunk forwarder that you want to send the system logs to Splunk Instance. To do this, type **/opt/splunkforwarder/bin/splunk add monitor /var/log**. This directory of /var/log is now being monitored. Now we have told the Universal Forwarder to monitor the content of var/log directory. 

  <img width="518" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f32a1c58-ec57-4ec4-8d2f-f26ef6e057a7" />

* But at this stage we have not yet told the forwarder the address of the splunk instance where the data needs to be sent.

## Step 4: Configure the UF to send data
* Tell Universal Forwarder where is the Splunk Instance (Port 9997) for it to send data (log files) to.
* Within the Universal Forwarder instance, type **/opt/splunkforwarder/bins/plunk add forward-server** add server where the data needs to be forwarded to so we need to specify the IP address of the Splunk instance + port number 9997.

## Step 5: Configure the UF to collect data from the host system
* Within Universal Forwarder instance, type
  Command Line -
  sudo ./splunk add monitor /var/log

  To collect data from var/log host system

* Type
  Command Line -
  sudo ./splunk restart

## Step 6: Verify that data is flowing successfully to Splunk Instance (Port 9997)
* Within Splunk instance, view the various logs that are successfully being sent from the var/log directory.

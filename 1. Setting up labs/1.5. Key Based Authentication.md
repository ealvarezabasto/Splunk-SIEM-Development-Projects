# Key Based Authentication

This file provides a comprehensive guide to create and add a publich SSH key to DigitalOcean Droplet using the UI-based approach and the command line.

**Description:** For this type of authentication, there are two special keys that are generated. One key is called a Public Key and second key is called a Private key.

If public key is stored in a server and is used as authentication mechanism, only the corresponding private key can be used to successfully authenticate.

* Open Windows Command Prompt and enable SSH by typing **ssh**

* Type **ssh-keygen** (in my case, a key has already been created.)

# Distributed Splunk Architecture

**Overview:** Splunk Enterprise consist of various other sub-components. These includes:
* Indexer --- clusertering feature exists
* Search Head --- clusertering feature exists
* Deployment Server
* Forwarders
* License Master
* Monitoring Consolde

## Indexer

**Description:** Component in Splunk Enterprise whose responsibility is to index data, transform data into searchable events, and placing results into an index.

## Indexer Clustering

* **Master Indexer node (Splunk Instance / Server #1):** The master node coordinates the activities of the peer nodes. It does not store or replicate data (aside from its own internal data).
  * A cluster has one, and only one master node.
  *  Master node coordinates activities of the peer nodes.
  *  it does not itself store or replicate data.
* **Peer node (Splunk Instance / Server #2 & Splunk Instance / Server #3):** nodes which has the actual data and performs the replicaiton related activities. Any search related activity request are sent to the peer nodes.  Peer nodes receive and index incorming data. They also replicate data from other nodes in the cluster.
   * **Replication:** If Peer Indexer Node 01 goes down, data should continue to persist in Peer Indexer Node 02 as there is an identical copy in Peer Indexer Node 02. Similarly, any data created in Peer Indexer Node 02, will also appear in Peer Indexer Node 01.
* **Search head node:** The search head manages searches across one or more clusters.

## License Master

**Description:** Saecifies how much external data you can index per day. The single license you purchase can only be utilized in a single Splunk instance. However, with the use of a License Master, it allows for that single license to be distributed to multiple Splunk instances.


## Serach Head

**Description:** Component in Splunk Enterprise whose responsibility is to handle the search management functions, directing search requests to search peers and then merging the results back to the users.

* Search Related Functions
* Building Dashboards and Reports
* Data Models
* Alerting 

## Monitoring Console

**Description:** Allows us to view detailed information about the topology and performance of your Splunk Enterprise deployment. Provides pre-built dashboars that give you visibility into many areas of your deployment, incluiding search and indexing performance, resource usage, license usage, and more. 

**Pre-built dashboards are:**

* search performance and distributed search framework
* indexing performance
* operating system resource usage
* Splunk app key value store performance
* search head and indexer clustering
* index and volume usage
* forwarder connections and Splunk TCP performance
* HTTP Event Collector performance
* and license usage

* Select 'Settings' > 'Monitoring Console'

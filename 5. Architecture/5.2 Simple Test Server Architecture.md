# Splunk Architecture

Splunk can be deployed in a viariety of configurations. Scales from a single server to a distributed infrastructure. Below is an example of a simple test server and it's 4 capabilities.

## 1. Data Input

* Data can be in any format: database servers, logs from a custmer, logs from network, switches, servers, mobile devices, and web-services.
* **Forwarder:** Collects data from different servers and sends it to Splunk for indexing purposes.

## 2. Parsing Stage

* Breaks data into events - rows in the database tables and then it stores data into the index.
* **Indexer:** Receives data from Forwarder and parses it (breaks it into different events based on that data) and then indexes it to Splunk.

## 3. Indexing

* Table in a relational database format
* **Licensing/License Meter:** Defines daily data volume limit that can be indexed into Splunk. You can't excede your license.

## 4. Searching

* Runs searches on those indexes to build reports on that data.
* SPL Language used to search

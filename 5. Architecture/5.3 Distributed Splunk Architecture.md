# Distributed Splunk Architecture

**Overview:** Splunk Enterprise consist of various sub-components. These includes:
* 1) License Master
* 2) Deployment Server
* 3) Monitoring Console
* 4) Forwarders
* 5) Indexer --- clusertering feature exists
  * 5.1) Cluster Master / Master Node
* 6) Search Head --- clusertering feature exists

## 1) License Master

**Description:** Specifies how much external data you can index per day. The single license you purchase can only be utilized in a single Splunk instance. However, with the use of a License Master, it allows for that single license to be distributed to multiple Splunk instances.
* Prevents you from exceeding your purchase limit.

## 2) Deployment Server/Deployers

**2.1) Deployment Sever:** Sends configuration and app updates to all the components including forwarder, indexer, and search head.

**2.2) Deployer:** Sends configuration and app updates only to the search head.

## 3) Monitoring Console

**Description:** Allows us to view detailed information about the topology and performance of your Splunk Enterprise deployment. Provides pre-built dashboars that give you visibility into many areas of your deployment, incluiding search and indexing performance, resource usage, license usage, and more. 

**Pre-built dashboards are:**

* search performance and distributed search framework
* indexing performance
* operating system resource usage
* Splunk app key value store performance
* search head and indexer clustering
* index and volume usage
* forwarder connections and Splunk TCP performance
* HTTP Event Collector performance
* and license usage

* Select 'Settings' > 'Monitoring Console'

## 4) Forwarders

**4.1) Universal Forwarder:** Collects and forwards the data coming from multiple resources to the index cluster (multiple indexes).

**4.2) Heavy Forwarder:** Collects, parses incoming data, filters it filters it, and sends data to the index cluster (multiple indexes).

## 5) Indexer

**Description:** Component in Splunk Enterprise whose responsibility is to index data, transform data into searchable events, and placing results into an index. Indexer is the place where the data resides.

### Indexer Clustering

**5.1) Cluster Master / Master Indexer node (Splunk Instance / Server #1):**
* **Description:** Coordinates all the activities and updates of an indexer within a cluster.
* The master node coordinates the activities of the peer nodes. It does not store or replicate data (aside from its own internal data).
  * A cluster has one, and only one master node.
  *  Master node coordinates activities of the peer nodes.
  *  it does not itself store or replicate data.
* **Peer node (Splunk Instance / Server #2 & Splunk Instance / Server #3):** nodes which has the actual data and performs the replicaiton related activities. Any search related activity request are sent to the peer nodes.  Peer nodes receive and index incorming data. They also replicate data from other nodes in the cluster.
   * **Replication:** If Peer Indexer Node 01 goes down, data should continue to persist in Peer Indexer Node 02 as there is an identical copy in Peer Indexer Node 02. Similarly, any data created in Peer Indexer Node 02, will also appear in Peer Indexer Node 01.
* **Search head node:** The search head manages searches across one or more clusters.

## 6) Search Head

**Description:** Component in Splunk Enterprise whose responsibility is to handle the search management functions, directing search requests to search peers and then merging the results back to the users. Part where the end-user writes a query to perform the search on the data. Data comes from the **indexer**.

* Search Related Functions
* Building Dashboards and Reports
* Data Models
* Alerting
* Ability to create Knowledge Objects (tags, event types, field aliases, create reports, monitor network)

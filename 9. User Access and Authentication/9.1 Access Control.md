# Access Control

**Description:** Splunk Enterprise Authentication allows us to create users, add them to roles/groups, and assign permissions to those roles.

## Authentication Methods

**Definition:** Splunk supports a variety of authentication techniques, enabling users to log in with a variety of credentials. These techniques include internal Splunk authentication, LDAP (Lightweight Directory Access Protocol) authentication, and SAML (Security Assertion Markup Language) authentication for Single Sign-On (SSO).

* Definition of Internal Authentication Type (default): Splunk Authentication (always on): whenever user tries to Splunk Enterprise, initially it will add for the admin username and password. Meaning authentication is internally managed by Spluonk and uses internal database.
* Definition of External Authentication Type: LDAP (Lightweight Directory Access Protocol) and SAML (Security Assertion Markup Language) are both protocols used in the realm of identity management and authentication, but they serve different purposes and operate in different contexts. 
  * LDAP: LDAP is primarily used for accessing and managing directory information services over a network. It is often used for storing user credentials and other related information in a directory service. It is commonly used for authentication and authorization, where applications can verify user credentials against an LDAP directory. It involved integrating your Splunk with an external directory like Microsoft AD, Windows Domain Account, or an open LDAP for user authentication. Meaning authentication will be managed externally. CONS: requires additional configuration to integrate and it can introduce dependencies on an external system. It can have a performance impact depending on the LDAP infrastructure. 
  * SAML: SAML enables Single Sign-On (SSO) capabilities, allowing users to authenticate once and gain access to multiple applications without needing to log in again. Allows Splunk to integrate with SAML identity providers such as SSO. User accounts and authentication are managed by this SAML IDP. PROS: seamless user experience through a single sign on.

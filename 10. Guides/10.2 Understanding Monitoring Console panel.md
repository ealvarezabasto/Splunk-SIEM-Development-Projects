# Understanding the Monitoring Console

**Definition:** The Splunk Monitoring Console (formerly known as the Splunk Distributed Management Console) is a tool within the Splunk platform designed for monitoring and managing Splunk deployments. It provides a centralized interface for administrators to oversee the health and performance of their Splunk environment.
**Note:** The Monitoring Console is visible only to users with the Splunk Enterprise admin role.

## Summary
**Description:** The Summary dashboard integrates the splunkd health report with monitoring console features, such as Health Check, to provide a dynamic environment for troubleshooting issues with your Splunk Enterprise deployment. You can use the Summary dashboard to monitor the health status of deployment components, track key deployment metrics, and investigate critical health issues detected by the splunkd health report.

## Indexing

## Search

### Search: Activity

## Resource Usage
* This topic is a reference for the Resource Usage dashboards in the Monitoring Console.
* The historical data in these dashboards comes from resource_usage.log in the _introspection index.
* In all of the resource usage dashboards, look for patterns that appear over time. For example, in the instance and machine dashboards, look for memory usage increasing over time without recovering.

### Resource Usage: Instance
* The Resource Usage: Deployment dashboard provides deployment-wide resource information, such as CPU usage, physical memory usage, and disk usage. These panels can be useful for capacity planning.
* In the Instance dashboard, if a process class that is using a lot of resources turns out to be search, investigate further by going to the Search activity: Instance dashboard.

### Resource Usage: Machine
* This dashboard can be useful for operational post mortems, as well as for capacity planning.

### Resource Usage: Deployment

### CPU Usage: Instance
* The CPU Usage by Instance panel shows the number of CPU cores (CPU/vCPU), CPU Usage (%), and Load Average for each instance in a distributed deployment. CPU Usage (%) and Load Average columns are color-coded based on the CPU status for each instance, as follows: 0-60 is green, 60-80 is yellow, 80-100 is orange, and 100+ is red.
* You can use this panel to track the status of CPU usage across multiple instances, and to maintain awareness of possible CPU overload conditions that can hurt performance.

### CPU Usage: Deployment
* The CPU Usage: Deployment dashboard shows physical CPU and virtual CPU (vCPU) usage across your distributed deployment.

## Forwarders
**Definition:** For this view, the Monitoring Console monitors forwarder connections.
* If these dashboards lack data z9as seen in the below screenshot panels), verify that you have completed all of the setup steps for the Monitoring Console, in either distributed or standalone mode.
* Like all Monitoring Console dashboards, these dashboards need metrics.log from the indexers. The Monitoring Console does not query forwarders directly for data, but rather gets its data from the indexers that the forwarders connect to.

### Forwrders: Deployment View
* **Splunk Recommendation:** Start at the Forwarders: Deployment view to see whether your forwarders are reporting as expected, or whether one of them is missing.
* This dashboard is paired with a preconfigured platform alert, which can notify you when one or more forwarders is missing.
